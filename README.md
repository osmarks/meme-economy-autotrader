# MemeEconomy Autotrader

This is a simple bot which attempts to make MemeCoins on the [MemeEconomy subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/MemeEconomy/) by investing in posts which are considered likely to be popular.

You can run your own instance of it - just create and fill in your own [praw.ini](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/configuration/prawini.html), and run `main.py`. This requires a reddit API key, as documented in that link. Please note that, due to its *very* simple method for determining whether to invest or not, some failure modes will become much more common given a large population of Autotraders.

Look at an instance in action [at its reddit acount](https://www.reddit.com/user/AutoMeme5000/) or [on the Meme Market page](https://meme.market/user.html?account=Automeme5000).
